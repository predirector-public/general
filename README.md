# About the project
When giving some lectures at the university I realized that there is no software where you can simply manage a complete conference on a single computer.
The idea of the app was to plan your presentations and integrate every documents from the speakers without installing a complex server side infrastructure.
Everyone knows the stuggle with the technics with different notebooks. 
So on the day of the presentation you can simply start the conference on one computer and adjust the schedule to changes during ongoing lectures.
After a some month, implementing some prototypes and stuggling hard, the software is released now. Try it for free and rate it afterwards Mac App Store. Thanks a lot :)
